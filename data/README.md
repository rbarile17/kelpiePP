# Datasets

We performed the experiments in the paper on three datasets: DBpedia50 (DB50K), DB100K and YAGO4-20. DB50K and DB100K are both samples of the DBpedia KG. We sampled YAGO4-20 from the YAGO4 KG. We extracted triples that mention entities involved in at least 20 triples. Next, we removed triples with literal objects.

For each dataset we provide three files containing the RDF triples: `train.txt`, `valid.txt`, `test.txt`.

The common aspect of these datasets is that along with the RDF triples they include or can be integrated with OWL (specifically OWL 2 DL) statements including the classes of the entities, as well as other schema axioms concerning classes and relationships. Such datasets can be regarded as ontologies with assertional (RDF) and terminological (OWL) knowledge. We require this feature as our approach heavily relies on a function _Cl_ returning the conjunction of the classes an entity belongs to. Moreover, the OWL schema axioms enable us to utilize the HermiT reasoner to enrich the output of _Cl_ with classes to which entities implicitly belong. We invoked the reasoner offline materializing all the implicit information. Hence, we executed our method without any other adjustment.

We highlight that for DB50k and DB100K only the RDF triples were available off the shelf. We retrieved the classes of the entities with custom SPARQL queries to the DBpedia endpoint, while the schema axioms are provided in the full version of DBpedia. Such schema axioms are defined in the `DBpedia.owl` file stored both in `data/DBpedia50` and in `data/DB100K`.

The integrated datasets are provided in the `data` folder. We describe anyway the process that we followed to build them, focusing on DB100K. Initially the available files were `data/DB100K/train.txt`, `data/DB100K/valid.txt`, `data/DB100K/test.txt` and `data/DB100K/DBpedia.owl`.
The txt files with the triples are defined using the ID of the entities in Wikidata instead of DBpedia, hence we computed a mapping by running:
```python
python -m src.semantic.DB100K.retrieve_mapping
python -m src.semantic.DB100K.replace_mapped_entities
```
obtaining the files `data/DB100K/mapped/train.txt`, `data/DB100K/mapped/valid.txt`, `data/DB100K/test.txt` which contains RDF triples on entities with the ID in DBpedia.

Next we integrated the triples with the semantic information. We executed the command:
```python
python -m src.semantic.retrieve_classes
```
to obtain `data/DB100K/entities.csv` containing the classes to which each entity in DB100K belongs.
Then we executed
```python
python -m src.semantic.load_ontology
```
to integrate the triples and the retrieved classes with the owl ontology obtaining the file `data/DB100K/DB100K.owl`.
Next we executed
```python
python -m src.semantic.reason
```
to materialize all the implicit information through the HermiT reasoner obtaining the file `data/DB100K/reasoned/DB100K_reasoned.owl`
Finally we executed
```python
python -m src.semantic.reasoned_onto_get_classes
```
to obtain the file `data/DB100K/reasoned/entities.csv` which contains for each entity the classes to which it belongs, including the implicit ones. Our extensions of Kelpie rely on this file.
We highlight that running the reasoner for the first time resulted in inconsistent ontologies. We repaired it modifying `data/DB100K/entities.csv`, `data/DB100K/mapped/train.txt` and `data/DB100K/DBpedia.owl` and we executed the reasoner again. In this repository we provide the repaired version of the files. The version history includes all the changes to the files to repair the onotlogies.
`data/DB100K/DB100K.owl` and `data/DB100K/reasoned/DB100K_reasoned.owl` are too big for GitHub. We uploaded them [here](https://figshare.com/s/ece7729bc1a7a8f64b26).

The process is analogous for DBpedia50.

For YAGO4-20 the process is different. 
Firstly, we downloaded YAGO4 [here](https://yago-knowledge.org/data/yago4/en/2020-02-24/).
Furthermore, we modified some axioms in the file `yago-wd-class.nt` obtaining the file `yago-wd-class-correct.nt` in the same folder to avoid unsatisfiability problems during reasoning. Download such file [here](https://figshare.com/s/ece7729bc1a7a8f64b26)
Next, we loaded the files `data/YAGO4-20/yago-wd-schema.nt` and `data/YAGO4-20/yago-wd-facts.nt` and `data/YAGO4-20/yago-wd-class-correct.nt` in GraphDB.
Then we executed all the cells in the notebook `notebooks/yago4.ipynb` to sample a set of triples from the complete KG obtaining the files `data/YAGO4-20/train.txt`, `data/YAGO4-20/valid.txt`, `data/YAGO4-20/test.txt`.
Then we executed all the cells in the notebook `notebooks/yago4_onto.ipynb` to obtain `data/YAGO4-20/YAGO4-20.nt`.
The notebooks are implemented considering GraphDB hosted on localhost and port 7200.
Next we executed 
```python
python -m src.semantic.reason
```
to obtain the reasoned version `data/YAGO4-20/YAGO4-20_reasoned.nt`.
Finally we executed
```python
python -m src.semantic.reasoned_onto_get_classes_yago
```
to obtain the file `data/YAGO4-20/reasoned/entities.csv`.
